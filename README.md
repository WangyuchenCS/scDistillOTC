## 🚀 Overview

**scDistillOTC** is a lightweight generative model designed to predict cellular responses to perturbations at the single-cell level.  


## 📂 Usage

PBMC Data is available in the \data folder. A complete example is provided in [`Tutorial.ipynb`](Tutorial.ipynb), which includes:

- 📥 Loading and preprocessing single-cell perturbation datasets  
- 🧠 Initializing and training the `scDistillOTC` model  
- 🔮 Predicting perturbation responses for unseen cell types  
- 📊 Visualization of results


## 📄 Documentation

Full documentation and API reference will be available upon paper publication.
